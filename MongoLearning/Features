As for the operations side of things, there are quite a few tools and features for MongoDB that you just can’t find with any other database system:

    Whether you need a standalone server or complete clusters of independent servers, MongoDB is as scalable as you need it to be
    MongoDB also provides load balancing support by automatically moving data across the various shards
    It has automatic failover support - in case your primary server goes down, a new primary will be up and running automatically
    The MongoDB Management Service or MMS is a very nice web tool that provides you with the ability to track your machines
    Thanks to the memory mapped files, you’ll save quite a bit of RAM, unlike relational databases
